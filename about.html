<p>Hello there! I am Jayson Vasquez a high school student from New York City.
  I have many interests including programming, history, and writing.</p>

<p>One of my greatest passions is writing. I have been working on creating my own
  fantasy project since 2020 and have begun to write a novel with the 
  working title of the Dawn Arrives. Currently on Chapter 42/70.</p>
<h2>Edison Hack Club</h2>
